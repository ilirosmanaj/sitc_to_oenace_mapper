# SITC to OENACE mapper

An automated mapper from SITC (Standard International Trade Classification) to Ã–NACE 
(Austrian nomenclature used for all industries and service activities).

## Setup

Install requirements via:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Used approach

The mapping procedure has three main steps:

* fuzzy matching based on the description of categories
    * think of incorporating semantic meaning as well (try some NLP approach)
    * enrich the dataset using correspondance tables. This does not match the codes for us, but rather gives
      the feeling of which terms are mentioned together. That can be used when matching (e.g. wheat is used together with
      word cereal) 
* build a model that would find similarities between categories, and if no good 
category is found, use it to find the _most fitting_ category 

### To research

* find if there is a model that finds similarities between different product 
  categories 
 
### Already tried

* [Dandelion API](https://dandelion.eu/) for the NLP approach
    * works relatively fine, but its quite expensive. For us, if we would use the brute-force approach of comparing
      all_sitc with all_oenace would be around 4 milion requets for every category. A load like this is not even supported
      by their offers (neither free nor paid).
    * As part of this, a bunch of other text similarity API-s were considered (e.g. [Parallel Dots](https://www.paralleldots.com/), 
     [TwinWord](https://www.twinword.com/api/text-similarity.php), [RxNLP](https://rxnlp.com/text-similarity-api/#.XaL5uuYzY5k)),
     but all of them are too expensive for use.

### Troubleshooting

If tkinter does not work, install python3-tk via (tested on ubuntu only):

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
